          <ol>
            <h2><li class='margin-top'>Building Rules</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Do not block off entire areas with props. If your job allows you to build in public, please do not obstruct:pathways, roads, world doors, or any frequently accessed areas
                <li>Do not block entrances to a building with props or entities. Windows are excluded from this rule
                <li>All real world entrances to your base must be clearly visible and easily accessible, which means you cannot use: crouching tunnels, areas where you have to jump, traps, mazes, invisible/semi-visible props, no collided props, disorientating lights/lamps/textures/colors/props/effect
                <li>You are not permitted to recolor/texture props that can be seen through (for example: fences). If you alter these props, you will be warned
                <li>You may prop block your base if you are actively constructing it, in which case you need to place a sign outside to tell people this. However you must NEVER prop block while your base contains any entities or valuable items. This includes any of your or your group member's items
                <li>Do not trap other players in bases.
                <li>Do not build anything that is not accessible by a natural path (no player-made catwalks on walls, etc)
                <li>Do not build anything that adds another path to an area (no ramps up to rooftops, catwalks, etc)
                <li>Do not completely block off the natural path to any area
                <li>Do not build in other players' bases without permission
                <li>Do not use or create one way props (they can't see you; you can see them). To be more clear about what this means you may not raise props to shoot under
                <li>Do not use or create invisible props
                <li>Do not build any obscene or inappropriate structures
                <li>Do not build in public unless your job's rules allow it. Public bases must be built to a reasonable scale. Follow the RP theme of the game mode: hobos can't afford mansions

                <li>You may use entities, like cars, to climb over things with them. However, you should never spam entities for this purpose. You cannot force raiders to have to use entities to enter smoothly
                <li>You are allowed kill slots in your base. Kill slot gaps must have at least a size of 2x2 cube stacked vertically and to open the slot you must use a toggled button
